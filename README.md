# self-made-soundboard

## Description:

This repository is dedicated to providing an open source option for running a soundboard/streamdeck.

## Requirements:

The code should be run on a raspberry pi. It should be connected to the computer via a 3.5mm audio cable 
(1. A 3.5mm splitter mic/speaker 2m to 1f should be used - the cable speaker plug to computer line-in, cable mic plug to computer line-out; 
2. I haven't done much testing yet, so the above might change over time).
Input is given via a keyboard attached to the pi. GPIO integration is comeing within the next 100 years I promise.

## Goals:
